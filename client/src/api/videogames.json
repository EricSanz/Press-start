Entirely rebuilt from the ground up and masterfully enhanced, this remake introduces the horrors of a fog-laden, dark fantasy land to a whole new generation of gamers. Those who have faced its trials and tribulations before, can once again challenge the darkness in stunning visual quality and incredible performance.",
                    "In his quest for power, the 12th King of Boletaria, King Allant channelled the ancient Soul Arts, awakening a demon from the dawn of time itself, The Old One. With the summoning of The Old One, a colourless fog swept across the land, unleashing nightmarish creatures that hungered for human souls. Those whose souls were stripped from them, lost their minds – left only with the desire to attack the sane that remained.",

As a lone warrior who has braved the baneful fog, you must face the hardest of challenges to earn the title “Slayer of Demons” and send The Old One back to its slumber."

Survivors live in a world where resources are scarce, violence and murder are common and Freakers roam the wilderness.",

For Deacon especially, it’s a struggle to ensure that hope never dies."

As Colt, players are trapped in a time loop on the enigmatic island of Blackreef, doomed to repeat the same day for eternity. The only chance for escape is to break the loop by unearthing information and assassinating eight key targets before the day resets. However, lurking in the shadows is rival assassin Julianna, equipped with her own equally powerful abilities and weapons, on a mission to protect the loop by assassinating Colt, and restarting the cycle.

The studio’s new IP will continue Arkane’s signature gameplay design, challenging gamers to play their own way. As Colt, players are trapped in a time loop on the enigmatic island of Blackreef, doomed to repeat the same day for eternity. The only chance for escape is to break the loop by unearthing information and assassinating eight key targets before the day resets. However, lurking in the shadows is rival assassin Julianna, equipped with her own equally powerful abilities and weapons, on a mission to protect the loop by assassinating Colt, and restarting the cycle. Players can also choose to take control of Julianna, turning DEATHLOOP into a deadly game of hunter-vs-hunted."

Enter Cappy, a small ghost who now finds himself as Mario’s hat. His new friend (sorry Luigi) provides quirky gameplay giving gamers the ability to temporarily control living and non-living things. The new duo take on a journey together, exploring the Odyssey and solving puzzles along the way.",

They can then modify with colour and distortion before sharing with their friends on social media. This new imaginative feature will no doubt lead to a barrage of Mario gameplay images shared online. The fun doesn’t have to stop at single-player mode. Join in with friends and play as Mario and Cappy together. Unique to the Nintendo Switch, gamers have the ability to play in co-op mode by using single Joy-Con controllers, so there’s even more hours of discovery to be had.",

The technical revolution has already occurred, robots, the Internet, holograms have already been invented, but all these innovations are immersed in the atmosphere of communism, imperialism and the confrontation with the West. The protagonist of the game, a Soviet special duty KGB officer, ends up in one of the 3826 Installation Complexes during a massive malfunction of the robot's control system. The game world consists of huge open-world regions filled with lush Soviet wilderness and less spacious territories of facility complexes with their secret underground and above-ground laboratories, bunkers, and robotic logistics systems. Most of the enemies are a variety of machines produced at the Facility. Each robot was originally manufactured to meet the needs of Soviet industry or to help Soviet citizens in daily life. The robots are implemented with a combat program that must be activated in the event of war."

                    "The God of War series has been entertaining gaming fans since 2005. No, that’s not a typo, this hugely successful franchise has been on the go for more than 10 years. With its unique blend of fighting mechanics and mythology, it’s easy to see why so many people have become encapsulated in the games.",
                    "Where the first range of games in the series has followed Greek mythology, the new God of War will be set within Norse mythology. This is a first for the franchise and something that was originally considered by video game designer, David Jaffe.",
                    "Designed as a sequel to 2010’s God of War III, the game will take place many years after the events of its predecessor with Kratos returning. Naturally, after so many years have passed, things within the game have changed. A bearded and world-weary Kratos now has a son, something shown in the title’s impressive trailers.",
                    "When it comes to gameplay, developers SIE Santa Monica Studio and publisher Sony Interactive Entertainment have called it a reimagining of the franchise, meaning there are some great new features for players to really get their teeth stuck into.",
                    "For those with an excellent memory, you may remember that Kratos lost his signature double-chained blades at the end of God of War III. Naturally, this means that he will not use them in the new game, instead opting for a magical battle axe known as the Leviathan Axe. This special weapon can be infused with elemental abilities and thrown at his enemies.",
                    "It’s not all new though, some of the combat mechanics that gamers loved from previous games return, but with a new coat of polish. These include the Spartan Rage ability, similar to Rage in previous instalments. Like in its predecessors, Spartan Rage allows Kratos to use incredibly powerful hand-based attacks that damage enemies massively.",
                    "Although God of War is played entirely as Kratos, there are times that gamers can choose to passively control his son, Atreus. In this instance, one button is dedicated to Atreus and its use depends on what is going on in-game. By this we mean that if Kratos needs help, the player can look towards an enemy, press the button and allow Atreus to take that enemy down with his bow.",
                    "With many of the same development team working on God of War as its predecessors, all of the impressive changes are rooted in the lore of the previous games. Despite its vast alterations and different mythology, it’s sure to feel like a proper God of War title. Couple this with the stunning performance capabilities of Sony’s PS4 and God of War is sure to be another sure fire hit in the franchise."
